With Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled, your organization can access the [emnify Portal](https://portal.emnify.com/) using your existing account credentials.

Currently, we support SSO for [Microsoft Active Directory](microsoft-active-directory), Open ID Connect, and [Google Cloud Platform](google-cloud-platform).
